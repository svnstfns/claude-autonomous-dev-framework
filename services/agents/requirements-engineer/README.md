# Requirements Engineer Agent Service

## Overview

Advanced NLP-based requirements engineering service that transforms natural language user requirements into structured, traceable specifications with SMART criteria validation.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK and spaCy integration for requirement parsing
- **SMART Criteria Validation**: Ensures requirements are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies requirement interdependencies and conflicts
- **Acceptance Criteria Generation**: Creates testable criteria for each requirement
- **Traceability Matrix**: Maintains requirement relationships and impact analysis
- **Memory Integration**: Stores requirement decisions and patterns for learning

### Technical Features
- **REQ-XXX Identifiers**: Structured requirement numbering system
- **Classification System**: Functional, non-functional, and constraint categorization
- **Quality Scoring**: Requirement completeness and clarity assessment
- **Documentation Generation**: Structured markdown output
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for framework integration

## Architecture

### Python Implementation
- **Core Engine**: `requirements_engineer_agent.py`
- **NLP Processing**: NLTK for tokenization, spaCy for advanced analysis
- **Data Models**: Structured requirement representation with dataclasses
- **Memory Integration**: SQLite-based persistence with framework memory service
- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for service integration

### Service Integration
- **Framework Integration**: Connects to main framework (port 8080)
- **Memory Service**: Uses framework memory service (port 8443)
- **Agent Coordination**: Participates in multi-agent workflows
- **Docker Container**: Containerized service (port 8082)

## Usage

### Direct API Access
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8082/health

# Process requirements
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requirements": "The system should allow users to export their data quickly",
    "project_context": "User management system"
  }'
```

### Framework Integration
The service integrates with the main framework through:
- **Agent Coordination**: Called by @agents/requirements-engineer
- **Memory Context**: Retrieves and stores requirement patterns
- **Workflow Integration**: Part of @workflows/feature-development

### Memory Integration
Requirements analysis results are automatically stored with semantic tags:
```json
{
  "content": "REQ-001: User data export functionality with <2sec response time",
  "tags": ["requirement", "functional", "user-data", "performance", "REQ-001"]
}
```

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Start the service
cd services/agents/requirements-engineer/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/requirements_engineer_agent.py

# Run with Docker
docker build -t claude-requirements-engineer .
docker run -p 8082:8082 claude-requirements-engineer
```

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Integration test with memory service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/test-integration
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `AGENT_ENV`: Service environment (development/production)
- `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL`: Framework memory service endpoint
- `AGENT_PORT`: Service port (default: 8082)

### NLP Configuration
- **NLTK Data**: Automatically downloads punkt and stopwords
- **spaCy Model**: Uses lightweight English model for processing
- **Custom Vocabulary**: Requirement-specific terminology enhancement

## Integration Patterns

### Agent Workflow
1. **Input Reception**: Natural language requirements from user/framework
2. **NLP Processing**: Tokenization, classification, and analysis
3. **Structure Generation**: SMART criteria validation and REQ-ID assignment
4. **Memory Storage**: Requirement patterns stored for future reference
5. **Output Delivery**: Structured markdown specifications

### Memory Service Integration
- **Pattern Learning**: Stores successful requirement patterns
- **Context Retrieval**: Accesses related requirements and decisions
- **Quality Improvement**: Learns from requirement validation outcomes
- **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Shares requirement patterns across projects

### Framework Coordination
- **Agent Registration**: Registers with framework agent registry
- **Task Distribution**: Receives requirement analysis tasks from orchestrator
- **Result Sharing**: Provides structured requirements to implementation agents
- **Quality Feedback**: Receives validation results for continuous improvement

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Criteria
- **SMART Compliance**: All requirements validated against SMART criteria
- **Completeness Check**: Ensures all requirement aspects are covered
- **Consistency Validation**: Checks for requirement conflicts and overlaps
- **Traceability Verification**: Maintains requirement relationship integrity

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: Requirement analysis time <2 seconds
- **Quality Score**: Requirement completeness and clarity metrics
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimal storage and retrieval patterns
- **Framework Integration**: Response time and coordination metrics

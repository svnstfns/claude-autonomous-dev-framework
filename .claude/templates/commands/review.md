## Review Comments Template

### üö® Critical Issue
```python
# ‚ùå Problem: SQL injection vulnerability
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# ‚úÖ Solution: Use parameterized queries
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))

# Explanation: Direct string interpolation in SQL queries
# can lead to SQL injection attacks. Always use parameterized
# queries to safely handle user input.
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Suggestion
```python
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Missing error handling
def process_data(data):
    result = external_api_call(data)
    return result['value']

# ‚úÖ Better: Add error handling
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = external_api_call(data)
        return result.get('value')
    except RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"API call failed: {e}")
        raise ProcessingError("Failed to process data") from e
```

### üí° Minor Improvement
```python
# üí° Suggestion: Use more descriptive variable name
# Instead of:
d = calculate_distance(p1, p2)

# Consider:
distance_km = calculate_distance(point_a, point_b)
```

### üëç Good Practice
```python
# üëç Great use of type hints and docstring!
def calculate_total(
    items: List[Item],
    tax_rate: float = 0.1
) -> Decimal:
    """
    Calculate total price including tax.
    
    Args:
        items: List of items to calculate
        tax_rate: Tax rate to apply (default 10%)
        
    Returns:
        Total price as Decimal for precision
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Review Categories

### Code Style Review
```python
# Check for:
# - PEP 8 compliance
# - Consistent naming conventions
# - Proper indentation
# - Line length limits
# - Import organization

# Tools to use:
# - black for formatting
# - isort for imports
# - ruff for linting
# - mypy for type checking
```

### Logic Review
```python
# Verify:
# - Algorithm correctness
# - Edge case handling
# - Boundary conditions
# - Off-by-one errors
# - Null/empty checks

# Example:
def find_index(items, target):
    # ‚ùå Doesn't handle empty list
    for i in range(len(items)):
        if items[i] == target:
            return i
    
    # ‚úÖ Better
    if not items:
        return -1
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        if item == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

### Security Review
```python
# Check for:
# - Input validation
# - Output encoding
# - Authentication checks
# - Authorization verification
# - Secure defaults
# - Cryptographic practices

# Example:
# ‚ùå Insecure: MD5 for passwords
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# ‚úÖ Secure: Use bcrypt or argon2
password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
```

### Performance Review
```python
# Look for:
# - N+1 query problems
# - Unnecessary loops
# - Inefficient algorithms
# - Missing indexes
# - Lack of caching

# Example:
# ‚ùå N+1 queries
users = User.query.all()
for user in users:
    posts = Post.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).all()

# ‚úÖ Eager loading
users = User.query.options(joinedload(User.posts)).all()
```
